# FlowFrame
This is a child of the Frame class in Tkinter with a method of add(widget), then all widgets flow in the FlowFrame.

I wanted text flow behavior of widgets in a tkinter Frame.  So I made this object, called a FlowFrame, which inherets
everything from the Frame class in Tkinter, but adds one method "add".  This way, whatever widgets are added to the frame,
they will flow like text.

I have included the object, and an example of widgets flowing in the FlowFrame object.
